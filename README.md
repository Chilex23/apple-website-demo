# This is a demo for the apple website that demonstrates the workflow of a user purchasing from the store.

I used the filesystem to store demo data in **JSON** format.

I used **Next.JS** for the project as it is perfect for social media links.

Run ``` npm run build ``` to get a build of the project `pre-rendered`.
